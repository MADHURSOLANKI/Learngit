# Simple MERN Stack Project

This is a basic MERN stack project with a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend.

## Getting Started

### Backend (Express)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the server with `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:5000).

### Frontend (React)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `client` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the React app with `npm start` (runs on http://localhost:3000).

The React app fetches a message from the backend API and displays it.
